- [ ] Support for additional database backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- [ ] API generation from CRUD models with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Export/import functionality (CSV, JSON, Excel, PDF)
- [ ] Audit logging and change tracking with user attribution

### Option E: Developer Experience
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation with interactive examples
- [ ] Migration utilities for upgrading between versions
- [ ] VS Code extension for schema development and validation
- [ ] CLI tools for project scaffolding and code generation
- [ ] Testing utilities and mock data generators

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Strengths
- **Clean Separation**: UI components completely independent of database logic
- **Flexibility**: Supports both traditional SQLAlchemy and modern Pydantic development patterns
- **Maintainability**: 10 focused widget handler methods with clear responsibilities
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new widgets, customize behavior, and extend functionality
- **Database Agnostic**: PydanticUi works independently, SqlUi handles database integration

### Technical Debt Status
- âœ… **Minimal**: Complete refactoring completed in Phase 3 with focused handlers
- âœ… **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage with integration validation
- âœ… **Documented**: Detailed completion summaries and implementation guides
- âœ… **Production Ready**: All critical bugs resolved, clean architecture established

### Recent Phase 3 Accomplishments
- **Widget Handler Refactoring**: Replaced monolithic methods with 10 dedicated handlers
- **SqlUi Integration**: Seamless PydanticUi integration with automatic schema detection
- **Foreign Key Architecture**: Clean separation with preloaded data and database-independent rendering
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Submit buttons restored, form pre-population working, numpy conversion fixed
- **Backward Compatibility**: Traditional SQLAlchemy workflows fully preserved

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Phase 4 based on user needs and priorities. All foundation work is complete with:
- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Full integration between components
- Production-ready implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation and examples

## Legacy API Cleanup (Completed)

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Added deprecation warning to `show_sql_ui` function
- [x] Replaced `base_key` with `key` parameter in SqlUi class with deprecation warnings
- [x] Added new `model` parameter for simplified API
- [x] Updated example project to use new API
- [x] Removed `show_sql_ui` function from exports
- [x] Removed internal `base_key` usage from all modules
- [x] Updated `create_delete_model.py`, `read_cte.py`, `many.py`, `sql_iu.py` to use `key` parameter

## Feature Requests

### Many-to-Many Relationship Support
**Requested**: December 2024  
**Use Case**: Support for Many-to-Many relationships through association tables

Currently, SqlUi supports One-to-Many relationships via the `update_show_many` parameter, but lacks native support for Many-to-Many relationships. 
This feature would be valuable for complex data models.

#### Requirements:
1. **Association Table Detection**: Automatically detect Many-to-Many relationships through association tables
2. **Multi-select Widget**: Use `st.multiselect` instead of `st.selectbox` for Many-to-Many fields
3. **Relationship Management**: Handle adding/removing records in association tables during create/update operations
4. **Transaction Support**: Ensure atomic operations when modifying multiple tables
5. **UI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing SqlUi interface

#### Proposed Implementation:
1. Add a new parameter `many_to_many_fields` to SqlUi:
   ```python
   SqlUi(
       conn=conn,
       model=MyModel,
       many_to_many_fields={
           'tags': {
               'relationship': 'tags',  # SQLAlchemy relationship name
               'display_field': 'name',
               'filter': lambda q: q.filter(Tag.active == True)
           }
       }
   )
   ```

2. Detect association tables from SQLAlchemy relationships
3. Generate multiselect widgets for Many-to-Many fields
4. Handle association table updates in transaction with main record

#### Benefits:
- Simplified UI for complex data relationships
- Reduced need for custom implementations
- Better support for common database patterns
- Maintains SqlUi's ease of use
